# Scalingo One Click Deployment

You can quickly setup a sample Scalingo CodiMD application by clicking the button below.

[![Deploy to Scalingo](https://cdn.scalingo.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://my.scalingo.com/deploy?source=https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd)

If you deploy it without the button, keep in mind to use the right buildpacks. For more details, check out [`scalingo.json`](https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd/blob/master/scalingo.json) and [`.buildpacks`](https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd/blob/master/.buildpacks).

## Deploy with custom branch

If you want to deploy CodiMD app with a custom branch instead of `master` branch, just add `#` followed by the name of the branch in the URL.

Example with `develop` branch:
```
https://my.scalingo.com/deploy?source=https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd#develop
```
